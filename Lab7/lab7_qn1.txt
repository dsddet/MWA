The design for such a problem considering scalability is having 2 collections.

1. Book Collection.
{
    _id:123,
    IsbnNumber:xyz,
    authors:[{author1:xyz},{author2:xyz},{author3:xyz}],
    keywords:["abc","efg","xyz"]
    }

2. Student Collection.
{
    _id:123,
    IsbnNumber:xyz,
    returnDate:'12-18-18'
}
