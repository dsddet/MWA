Request-Param is a spring annotation that allows for automatic data binding of form elements or parameter values with the proceeding variable after the @Request-param annotation.

public String getUser(@RequestParam("userName") String user)

Gets the userName value of the form field and binds it to the user variable.


@RequestMapping("/get/{user}/data")
public String getData( @PathVariable("user") String user){

return "someJSPPage";
}

Path variable extracts a sub-string from a URL and binds it to a variable. It is used to get resource requests contained in a request path url.
for example, the relative url "get/deusdedit/data" would bind the variable user to string "deusdedit".


The major components of the spring webflow are client, dispatcher Servlet, HandlerMapping,Controller, ViewResolver and viewEngine.

1. The DispatcherServlet consults the HandlerMapping and invokes the Controller associated with the request.
2. The Controller process the request by calling the appropriate service methods and returns a ModeAndView object to the DispatcherServlet. The ModeAndView object contains the model data and the view name.
3. The DispatcherServlet sends the view name to a ViewResolver to find the actual View to invoke.
4. Now the DispatcherServlet will pass the model object to the View to render the result.
5. The View with the help of the model data will render the result back to the user.
