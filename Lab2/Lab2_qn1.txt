1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
 We use setImmediate to register a callback in the check phase of the event loop. setTimeout registers call back in timer phase of event loop.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
 Process.nextTick registers call back in nextTick.queue that is processed immediately after the current phase finishes. setImmediate will set callback in 
the check phase only.
